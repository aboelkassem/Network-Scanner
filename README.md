# Network scanner

> A small project that I wrote on the fly for (IT351) Computer Networks University Course to identify and label the devices in my networks and open ports.

# Technical Points
- Built using `python` and `socket` library for TCP Scanning
- Built GUI with `PyQt5` library
- There are another version which using `scapy` library for ARP Scanning

## How to use

### Getting started
 1. clone or download the project and `cd` into the project folder
 2. install dependencies
    1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### How to run
1. run: `python main.py` or from IDE like PyCharm
2. input network to scan: e.g. `192.168.1.1`

***Scanning could take a little while (around 20sec - 2min is normal). In addition, it may have to be run several times to get all devices.***
